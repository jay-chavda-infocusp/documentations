# Introduction to React

Welcome to the React Documentation Repository! This guide serves as a curated collection of resources that comprehensively cover key concepts, features, and best practices in React. Whether you're starting with the basics or looking to master advanced topics, this documentation is designed to help you build efficient, scalable, and maintainable React applications.

## Table of Contents

1. [JSX](./mastering-jsx-in-react/README.md)
   - Discover the power of JSX, React's syntax extension, which allows you to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript. Understand its rules, dynamic capabilities, and how it simplifies UI creation.

2. [Props & State](./understanding-props-and-state-in-react/README.md)
   - Learn the difference between props and state, their roles in React components, and best practices for passing data and managing dynamic behavior.

3. [Event Handlers](./react-event-handlers-guide/README.md)
   - Explore how React handles user interactions with event handlers, including passing arguments, managing events, and best practices for clean and efficient code.

4. [Styling](./styling-in-react/README.md)
   - Examine the various ways to style React components, including inline styles, CSS modules, styled-components, and more. Find out which approach suits your project's needs.

5. [Hooks](./react-hooks/README.md)
   - Dive into React Hooks, a feature that enables you to use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features in functional components. Learn about core hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and creating custom hooks.

6. [React Router](./react-router-guide/README.md)
   - Master routing in React applications with React Router. Learn about dynamic and nested routes, navigation, and the latest features in React Router v7.

7. [State Management / Redux](./state-management-with-redux/README.md)
   - Gain an in-depth understanding of managing complex state across your application using Redux, including middleware, actions, reducers, and best practices.

8. [Context API](./context-api-in-react/README.md)
   - Explore how to use React's Context API to share global data across components without prop drilling, and understand when to prefer it over other state management solutions.

9. [Error Handling](./error-handling-in-react/README.md)
   - Learn how to handle errors gracefully in React applications with error boundaries, `react-error-boundary`, and best practices for providing fallback UI.

10. [High-Order Components (HOC)](./higher-order-components-hoc-in-react/README.md)
    - Understand how to enhance component functionality by reusing logic with High-Order Components (HOCs) and best practices for their implementation.

11. [Lazy Loading](./lazy-loading-in-react/README.md)
    - Optimize your application’s performance by implementing lazy loading for components and assets using React’s `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

12. [Testing - Learn About Unit Testing in React](./testing-in-react-with-jest-and-react-testing-library/README.md)
    - Develop robust React applications by learning how to write unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library. Understand test structure, mocking, and best practices.
