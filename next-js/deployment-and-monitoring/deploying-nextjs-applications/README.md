# Deploying Next.js Applications

## Overview

Deploying a Next.js application involves taking your development build and making it accessible to users via a hosting platform. Next.js supports various deployment options, including static site hosting, serverless deployments, and custom server configurations.

This guide walks through the best practices, hosting options, and deployment processes for Next.js applications.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Deploying on Vercel

Vercel is the creator of Next.js and provides seamless deployment and hosting tailored for Next.js applications.

#### Steps to Deploy on Vercel:

1. **Connect Your Repository**:
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and log in.
   - Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

2. **Configure Project**:
   - Select your Next.js project.
   - Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures the build and output settings.

3. **Deploy**:
   - Vercel builds and deploys your project automatically.
   - Access your app at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`.

#### Advantages:
- Zero-configuration deployment.
- Automatic scaling and serverless execution.
- Built-in support for ISR, SSR, and API routes.

### 2. Deploying on Static Hosting Platforms

For applications using **Static Site Generation (SSG)**, you can deploy to platforms like Netlify, AWS S3, or GitHub Pages.

#### Steps for Static Deployment:

1. **Build the Static Files**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run export
   ```
   - The static files will be generated in the `out` directory.

2. **Upload to Hosting**:
   - Use your platform's CLI or web interface to upload the `out` directory.

#### Popular Static Hosting Options:
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop your `out` directory or use the CLI.
- **AWS S3**: Upload files to an S3 bucket and configure it for static website hosting.
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy the `out` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.

### 3. Deploying on Custom Servers

If you need a custom setup (e.g., integrating with other backend services), you can deploy your Next.js app on platforms like AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, or Heroku.

#### Steps for Custom Server Deployment:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build Your Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run on a Node.js Server**:
   Use a process manager like PM2 to keep your server running:
   ```bash
   pm2 start npm --name "next-app" -- start
   ```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are essential for storing sensitive information like API keys and database credentials. Configure them properly for your deployments.

### Defining Variables

1. **Local Development**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in your project root.

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   ```

2. **Production**:
   - Define variables in your hosting platform's dashboard (e.g., Vercel Environment Variables).

### Accessing Variables in Next.js

- Use `process.env` to access variables in your code.

  ```javascript
  const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
  ```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Environment-Specific Configurations**:
   - Ensure your app behaves correctly in development, staging, and production environments.

2. **Optimize Builds**:
   - Use `npm run build` to create optimized production builds.

3. **Monitor and Debug**:
   - Use tools like Vercelâ€™s analytics or third-party monitoring services to track performance and errors.

4. **Secure Sensitive Information**:
   - Never expose private keys or credentials in the client-side code.

5. **Test Before Deployment**:
   - Test your application thoroughly in a production-like environment.

|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Vercel**  | Seamless Next.js integration, serverless functions     | Best for full-featured Next.js apps   |
| **Netlify** | SSG support, drag-and-drop interface                   | Static sites and Jamstack applications|
| **AWS**     | Flexible configurations, global scalability           | Custom setups and enterprise apps     |
| **Heroku**  | Simple Node.js deployment, scaling options             | Small to medium-sized apps            |

## Debugging Deployment Issues

1. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Review build logs provided by your hosting platform to identify errors.

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required variables are defined and correctly configured.

3. **Enable Debugging**:
   - Use `NEXT_DEBUG` during local builds to troubleshoot.

4. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Use tools like Lighthouse or hosting platform analytics to identify bottlenecks.
